    <h5>FOURTH ACT</h5>
    <h6> Description: Morning-room in Sir Robert Chiltern’s House </h6>

<p>
 LORD GORING.  [_To himself_.]  Ah! that is something.
 <br>

JAMES.  Lord Caversham has been waiting some time in the library for Sir
Robert.  I told him your lordship was here.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Thank you!  Would you kindly tell him I’ve gone?
<br>
JAMES.  [_Bowing_.]  I shall do so, my lord.
<br>
[_Exit servant_.]
<br>
LORD GORING.  Really, I don’t want to meet my father three days running.
It is a great deal too much excitement for any son.  I hope to goodness
he won’t come up.  Fathers should be neither seen nor heard.  That is the
only proper basis for family life.  Mothers are different.  Mothers are
darlings.  [_Throws himself down into a chair_, _picks up a paper and
begins to read it_.]
<br>
[_Enter_ LORD CAVERSHAM.]
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Well, sir, what are you doing here?  Wasting your time
as usual, I suppose?
<br>
LORD GORING.  [_Throws down paper and rises_.]  My dear father, when one
pays a visit it is for the purpose of wasting other people’s time, not
one’s own.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Have you been thinking over what I spoke to you about
last night?
<br>
LORD GORING.  I have been thinking about nothing else.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Engaged to be married yet?
<br>
LORD GORING.  [_Genially_.]  Not yet: but I hope to be before lunch-time.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  [_Caustically_.]  You can have till dinner-time if it
would be of any convenience to you.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Thanks awfully, but I think I’d sooner be engaged before
lunch.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Humph!  Never know when you are serious or not.
<br>
LORD GORING.  Neither do I, father.
<br>
[_A pause_.]
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  I suppose you have read _The Times_ this morning?
<br>
LORD GORING.  [_Airily_.]  The Times?  Certainly not.  I only read _The
Morning Post_.  All that one should know about modern life is where the
Duchesses are; anything else is quite demoralising.
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  Do you mean to say you have not read _The Times_ leading
article on Robert Chiltern’s career?
<br>
LORD GORING.  Good heavens!  No.  What does it say?
<br>
LORD CAVERSHAM.  What should it say, sir?  Everything complimentary, of
course.  Chiltern’s speech last night on this Argentine Canal scheme was
one of the finest pieces of oratory ever delivered in the House since
Canning.
